  text: 'It is the deliberate manipulation of nearly-omnipresent nanites; microscopic
    machines left behind by a dead empire and now woven into the fabric of countless
    worlds. By exerting intense mental focus, a Nanomancer issues commands that these
    swarms obey: heat blooms, wounds knit, and objects move.'

    text: A Nanomancer’s abilities function only in the presence of nanites. Most
      places have at least a low density of nanites, though it’s not unheard of for
      a planet or space station to be entirely devoid of nanites. Some planets (especially
      former Imperial core worlds) have high or even extreme densities of nanites,
      while some Nanomancers take to bringing nanites with them wherever they go.
      Nanomantic Effects cannot be used when Nanite density is 0. Nanite density is
      abbreviated ND for the remainder of this section.
