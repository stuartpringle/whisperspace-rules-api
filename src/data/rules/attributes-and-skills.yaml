  - type: paragraph
    text: Attributes are a measurement of how focused on different areas of development
      your character is. For example, an athlete would have a high PHYS, since they’ve
      developed their body primarily. A scientist would likely have a high MENT.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: Attributes act as skill categories, are sometimes asked for in the form
      of attribute rolls (such as rolling a reflex check to determine your initiative
      order in combat), and also as a baseline for all skills related to them. No
      skill check can have a result lower than its related attribute.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: For example, if your character has a PHYS attribute of 2 but a Powerlift
      of 0, every Powerlift check you roll will have a result of 2 or higher (even
      if you roll a 1 and add -1 from your Powerlift skill, which would normally give
      you a result of 0). This reflects that, although you are not a particularly
      gifted powerlifter, your generally good physique allows you to have some basic
      competence in that area.

      text: Skill levels determine what modifier you add to your skill check roll.
        Except for level 0 skills (completely untrained), you will add your skill
        rank as a modifier to all checks for that skill. For example, a Melee (weapons)
        skill check would entail rolling 1d12 and adding your Melee (weapons) skill
        rank to it.

          roll with a -1 modifier. This emphasizes the difference between an untrained
          skill (modifier of -1) and a trained skill of rank 1 (modifier of +1).
