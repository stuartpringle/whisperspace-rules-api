    text: If you think of player action as a desire and a question (‘I want to climb
      the wall. Do I succeed?’), then you can think of this core mechanic as the GM’s
      way of answering that question (‘Roll 1d12 and add your athletics skill to it.
      If you get at least 8, you succeed climbing the wall’).

      one.

  content:
  - type: paragraph
    text: Difficulty Class (usually referred to as DC) is a target number a roll must
      meet or exceed in order to succeed. In the example above, the GM decided that
      a DC of 8 was required to successfully climb a wall.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: DC can be mechanically decided in some contexts (such as combat; an attack
      roll must meet or exceed a DC determined by the weapon used, whether the target
      is behind cover, etc), while at other times the GM may be responsible for determining
      DCs ‘on the fly’.

    content:
    - type: paragraph
      text: Not all successes (or failures) are created equal. In cases where the
        skill check rolled is significantly higher or lower than the DC, additional
        consequences may occur. Extreme successes may be rewarded narratively (at
        the GM’s discretion) or mechanically in systems such as combat. Conversely,
        extreme failures may bring about negative consequences in addition to the
        action’s failure.
      spans: []
    - type: paragraph
      text: In the wall-climbing example given above, the DC was 8. If a character
        rolls a 14 (6 over) they’re in extreme success territory; maybe they climb
        the wall in half the time, or maybe they move soundlessly while they do it.
        If the roll is a 4, however, they’re in extreme failure territory - maybe
        they climb partway, then fall and take damage, or an enemy is alerted to their
        presence.

      dice or impose penalty dice to your character on a roll. Bonus and penalty may

    - type: paragraph
      text: You may certainly come across situations in which you will receive a bonus
        die from more than one source. These are used together (they ‘stack’) up to
        a maximum of 2 bonus dice. The same is true of penalty dice. If you were to
        roll an attack with 2 penalty dice, for example, you would roll 3d12 (one
        from the attack action, 2 as penalty dice), choose the lowest number on any
        of those dice, then add your modifier to that number.
      spans: []
    - type: paragraph
      text: Bonus dice and penalty dice cancel each other out. Let’s say you receive
        2 Bonus dice and 1 Penalty die on a roll. 1 Penalty die would cancel out 1
        Bonus die, leaving you to make your roll with 1 Bonus die. 2 Bonus dice and
        2 Penalty dice would equate to no Bonus or Penalty dice; you’d simply make
        the normal roll. 4 Bonus dice and 2 Penalty dice would leave you with 2 Bonus
        dice to roll.
