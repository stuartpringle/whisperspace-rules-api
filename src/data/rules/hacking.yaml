    the security camera feed from a convenience store, or force security drones to
    view you and your allies as friendlies, hacking can be an incredibly powerful
    tool, depending on the campaign setting and goals.

    text: Simple Hacking consists of making a single Hacking skill check (the DC per
      tier level is determined by the table above). On a success, the effect the character
      wished to achieve is achieved. On a failure, countermeasures kick in or the
      hack simply fails.

        to safeguard them from unwanted intrusion. These range from simple access
        logs that prove someone was in the system to advanced active countermeasures
        like Spikes, which can disrupt the hack, detect the location of the hacker,
        or even damage the hacker’s rig.
      spans: []
    - type: paragraph
      text: These countermeasures work together to keep systems safe. They only trigger
        when illicit activity is detected - this is known as the system’s Alert Level.

    - type: paragraph
      text: For each failed (or skipped) step, the system’s Alert Level goes up by
        1. When it reaches 5, the system is fully aware it is being infiltrated and
        will use its countermeasures to full effect.

      text: Some countermeasures may activate before the system’s Alert Level gets

      - type: paragraph
        text: Software is really the backbone of any hacking attempt. These are code
          snippets and scripts used to perform specific functions during a hack. To
          perform a hacking Scan, for example, a character is required to have software
          that can perform the Scan active on his rig. Many software packages allow
          more than one hack type, and some even provide bonuses to those hacks.
        spans: []
      - type: paragraph
        text: A character may attempt to use software of a lower tier than the system
          he is breaking into during a hack, if he wishes. Doing so increases the
          DC of the hack by the difference in tiers. For example, attempting to use
          a Tier 1 scan program on a Tier 3 system would result in a DC of 11 (base
          DC for hacking a Tier 3 system is 9, the difference between Tier 1 and Tier
          3 is two, 9 + 2 = 11). Conversely, using software of a higher tier than
          the system reduces the DC by the difference in tiers.
