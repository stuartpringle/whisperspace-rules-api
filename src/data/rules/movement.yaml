  text: In Whisperspace, each character has a Speed stat based on their PHYS. You
    may use an action to move up to your speed (for example, 35 feet). This movement
    can be interwoven between other actions on your turn. For example, you may use
    the move action to move 10 feet closer to a target, then use the attack action
    to try to hit them, then move another 10 feet away from them, use an interact
    action to open a door, then move your remaining 15 feet through that door and
    behind cover.

    text: Certain types of movement (swimming, crawling) may impose movement penalties,
      preventing you from moving as far as normal, while some cyberware or other effects
      may provide movement bonuses, allowing you to move farther than normal. Bonuses
      stack with each other, as do penalties; and bonuses and penalties cancel one
      another out. For example, if you had 2 movement bonuses and 1 penalty, the end
      result would be that you would move with 1 bonus. Similarly, having 3 movement
      penalties and 1 movement bonus would result in you moving with 2 penalties.
