    text: A system post-collapse, the Shatterbelt was the dominion of the Halcyon
      Empire. Emperor Galen Halcyon IV could not hold together what nearly a thousand
      years of effort and bloodshed had built; the collapse happened almost overnight.
      Civil war swept through what had once been a united galaxy, dozens of once-prosperous
      worlds were wiped clean of life, cleansing fire rained down from orbiting ships.
      In the span of less than a decade, over one tenth of the galaxy’s population
      died. Through years of in-fighting and power struggles, the mighty fleets of
      the Halcyon Empire vanished, and the void that was left in the empire’s wake
      was filled by hundreds of factions each hungry for power. Piracy sprang up and
      Whisper cults formed as the population of the galaxy tried to make sense of
      what was happening.

    text: Thirty-five years after the fall of the Halcyon Empire, most of the direct
      conflict has ceased. Modern-day skirmishes are a far cry from the full-scale
      warfare of Collapse. Now, a handful of factions hold sway over large swaths
      of the Shatterbelt, while independent planetary governments oversee and tax
      their own systems like so many petty kingdoms.

    text: Stretching across half the galaxy and including hundreds of solar systems,
      inhabited and otherwise, the Shatterbelt is the name for a collection of solar
      systems reaching half-way across the known galaxy. These systems once made up
      the majority of the Halcyon Empire’s holdings, and were once united without
      exception. After the Collapse, the name ‘Shatterbelt’ seems prophetic to some.

      and the slow movement of the ‘jump points’, the ways in and out of Whisperspace.
      While the Anchorate is not a political body, they do have considerable sway,
      for without them Whisperspace would quickly become impossible to navigate.

      to some, it is a power greater than any other; the whispers within are a warning,
      a revelation, or even prophecy. These beliefs are the core of Whisper Cults.
      They view Whisperspace not for what it is but what it could be. Many worship
      the silence. Some make it their mission to enter into Whisperspace as many times
      as possible in the belief that hearing the whispers more often may make comprehending
      them possible. Still others think listening to the whispers brings wrath upon
      us all, that those sounds are not for our ears or our minds.

        On some worlds, nanites were employed not only to keep the population healthy

        were instructed to search out individuals with higher than normal blood pressure
        and heart rates, and slowly manipulate their cells to calm them down. One
        experiment even went so far as to instruct nanites to trigger the production
