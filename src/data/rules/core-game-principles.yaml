    text: Whisperspace includes many frameworks for how to resolve different types
      of situations. However, sometimes these may appear to be in conflict with other
      rules (weapon keywords, archetype bonuses, etc). In such cases, the specific
      rule is taken over the general rule. If the rules for combat tell you that making
      a Called Shot gives you a penalty die, but an archetype feature says you can
      ignore that penalty die, then the specific rule from your archetype will apply,
      overruling the general rule of combat actions.

    - type: paragraph
      text: The Game Master (or GM) is the final authority for how the rules of this
        system work. A good GM will work with players to make an experience everyone
        will enjoy; this system provides a framework to help do that. Thus, whenever
        a question arises of how a rule should be applied, the GM is the arbitrator.
        It’s their call whether they want to agree with a player’s interpretation
        or not - or even use a particular rule in this system or not!

      and your Rifle skill adds +3. That’s your side of the roll.

      The GM sets the DC higher than normal because of the target’s cover. You can’t
      control your enemy’s cover; that’s the world making things more difficult for
      you.'
