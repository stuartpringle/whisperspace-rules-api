  text: Many call Empathy a gift; others, a curse. Feeling - not just sensing, but
    feeling - the emotions of others around you is exhausting, and Empathy doesn’t
    have an ‘off’ switch. Those who are blessed (or cursed) with it must bear their
    unique abilities as an ever-present burden.

- type: paragraph
  text: Some Empaths go insane. The constant weight of others’ feelings is too much
    and they cannot handle the strain. Others seclude themselves, hiding away from
    the world in the most remote locations imaginable to escape their ‘gift’. Still
    others seek to find ways to live with it, to harness it; draw away stress and
    the sting of traumatic emotion from those around them, or quell dangerous feelings
    before they can boil to the surface.

  text: Then there are Empaths who embrace their gift. They wreak havoc with the emotions
    of those around them for sport and revel in their power over their fellow man.
  spans: []
- type: paragraph
  text: However they cope with their gift, Empaths are a small group of people from
    all over the Shatterbelt who are capable of feeling and at times intentionally
    altering the emotional state of living creatures around them. They can defuse
    fights before they start, or conjure them up between friends. Their services are
    always in high demand, both for good and ill.
