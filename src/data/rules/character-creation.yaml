  text: A character is a player’s portal into the world of the game. What your character
    does is really what you do. Are you going to take on the universe as a rogue with
    a good heart (Han Solo, for example) or a bounty hunter only really interested
    in profit? What about as a research scientist looking into the recent outbreak
    of a deadly virus?

    text: Modeling your character around a concept you like is a great way to start.
      Maybe you’re inspired by Han Solo and want to build a scoundrel with a heart
      of gold, or maybe you like Paul Atreides and think someone trained in melee
      fighting and leadership is the character for you. Having a character concept
      in mind can help each decision you make bring you that little bit closer to
      what you had in mind.

      encapsulates where he comes from. Motivation shows where he’s going - what he
      wants to do. These are narrative devices you can use to give depth and personality
      to your character. They can double as great story hooks for your GM to use as
      well.
