    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: You use your weapon skill to fire the weapon. As with any skill roll, this
      requires you to roll a D12 and add your skill modifier to it. Thus, to fire
      a light weapon, you would roll a D12 and add your Light Weapons combat skill
      to the result.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: To hit, you must meet or exceed your weapon’s DC. This reflects the fact
      that different weapons are easier or more difficult to fire accurately. If your
      light weapon has an accuracy of 10, then you would need to get 10 or higher
      with your roll to hit the target. However, other factors may enter into the
      equation. For example, your target may be behind partial cover (a +2 to the
      DC to hit), which would mean you would instead need a 12 or higher to hit them.
    spans: []
  - type: paragraph
    text: 'Distance is also a factor here: each weapon has a Range attribute. Firing
      a weapon at a target outside (farther away) than the weapon’s Range results
      in a +2 increase to the DC to hit per range band farther the target is from
      you. So if you were to fire a weapon with a range of Near at a target at Long
      distance, you would be crossing two range bands (Medium, Long), so the DC for
      your attack would go up by +4. Firing across three range bands (from Near to
      Very Long, for example) is considered an impossible shot and you automatically
      miss.'
