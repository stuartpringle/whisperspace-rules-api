  items:
  - text: Player characters (PCs) are fragile humans. Getting shot by a machine gun
      causes massive trauma whether the person who shot you is a level 1 character
      or a level 100 character. Your character won’t typically become inherently harder
      to kill simply by gaining skills (though better armour can always be worn).
    spans: []
  - text: Being in combat takes a toll on even the bravest. To reflect this, Whisperspace
      has a Stress system that can permanently impact characters.
    spans: []
  - text: 'Movement and positioning matters in combat. Are you hiding behind a spaceship
      so the bad guy can’t shoot you? Good: that means they can’t shoot you. Hollywood
      gunfights are fun to watch, but in Whisperspace, you rarely want to be standing
      out in the open, presenting yourself as an easy target.'

- type: paragraph
  text: Whisperspace is a gritty, cinematic sci-fi TTRPG about survival, control,
    and consequence in a fractured galaxy. You’re not a superhero. You’re a specialist
    with a past, a pulse, and a purpose — doing jobs others can’t (or won’t) in forgotten
    places.

  text: Yet play is not designed to feel hopeless. It’s exciting, yes. Difficult,
    certainly. But never meaningless. Characters may die — but others will rise to
    take up their causes. The most compelling stories aren’t about people getting
    everything they want with ease. They’re about struggle, resilience, and eventually
    triumphing against the odds.
  spans: []
- type: paragraph
  text: Whisperspace mirrors that narrative structure. Everyone wins when the party
    succeeds — but the GM isn’t going to say “Congratulations, you win!” the moment
    you sit down. Success is earned. Victory is earned. And when it comes, it will
    mean something.
